This challenge used a basic encryption method that applied a **polynomial-based transformation** to the original string (likely the flag). The encryption formula in the source or the given file hinted at a reversible transformation.

The core idea was to **reverse the transformation** using basic algebra or code. By analyzing how the encryption altered each character or number, I reconstructed the inverse logic â€” essentially decoding the polynomial function step-by-step.

This was done either by:
- Manually deducing the inverse formula
- Or writing a simple Python script to reverse it

this is the question encryption code:
