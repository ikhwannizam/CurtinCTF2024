## Challenge Summary

The challenge seemed to involve identifying a number-based flag, potentially involving prime numbers. Given the limited range (1 to 100), a brute-force approach was practical.

I wrote a simple script that iterated through all integers from 1 to 100 and checked whether each number was prime. For each prime number (and also for some non-primes for completeness), I formatted it in the expected flag format and submitted it until I found the correct one.

This technique works well when:

- The flag is based on a mathematical property (like primality)
- The input space is small (1â€“100)
